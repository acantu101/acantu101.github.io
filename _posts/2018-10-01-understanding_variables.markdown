Variables can be pass by values or pass by reference.

1. Pass by values meaning that no variable will follow the value of another.  When creating a new valuee under a different name, the valu will revert back to the original after masking it with a new value.
2. A pass by referece on the other hand can alter the value of the virst variable. 

Variables can't have spaces or keys. thy have to be typed in either or one of the following forms:

one_way_to_name_variables
another_way_to_name_variables
