When I was younger, tecnology amazed me. I wanted the new playstation and the awesome new gadgets likes the laser keyboard. I wanted to know what gadgets we would have in the next 10 years and I would often imagine how far we could go. Fast forward, about 10 years later here I am. I currently work as a contractor for Instagram. I help engeniers move fast. That's the motto. For someone who hasn't had any coding education, I have come a long way. 

Everyone always talks about how coding is the hardest skill to get. If you say you know how to program, people will automatically think of you as a genius. That scared me off of the possibility of getting a college degree on computer science. However, I have always stayed close to my computer, being able to navigate around the web and around different programs with ease.

It also, doesn't hurt that I am in Austin, Texas. One of the new tech hubs in the world. It's cheap realestate has brought so many big names in tech. The small downtown area is now filled with buildings carrying millenial badges such as "Indeed", "Google", "Home Away,' etc. I imagined myself walking across the streets of downtown, working in one of those big companies and hanging out for happy hour with co-workers after work. It was a dream. I mentalized it so much, that one day I got a call from a recruiter asking me if I wanted to interview with Facebook. I couldn't believe it.

I took the job. As a contractor, I don't get most of the benefits that people have popularized from Facebook such as dry cleaning, free phones, holidays, among others. Pay is okay and work volume is unmanageable. They however, have full time employees that manage my project and make sure we all get trainned. Learning the ins and outs of how Instagram operates was hard at first. I would confuse iOS and Android tasks and send them to the incorrect platform team. I also had a hard time learning the different eng teams that work within IG and the new fatures that they were building. 

Fast forward again to two years later, and here I am. I got a scholarship with Lift and I am finally taking a step towards becoming a certified programmer. I look at what the enegeniers I work with do and I get so excited. To do what they do is a dream that I am hopefully mentalizing enough and that I can manifest in a few years. I want to be able to build tools that the world needs and wants. I want to solve problems through programs that habitate in the app store world.
