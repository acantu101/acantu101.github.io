In object oriented ruby I learned that using instance variables is very valuable when reusing the same variable in different methods and then calling it in the CLI with the call method. It really simplified my code and allowed me to write cleaner and smaller code.

For this project I used the help of a developer friend who showed me how to orginized my folders. And I used my father's company needs to come up with an idea. He pints pictures and wanted to have a list of products of his competitor with a range of the prices.

It was hard at first but once you get the hand of it and using all th diffeent gems it became easy and fun.
